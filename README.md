# Manufacturing-Downtime-Analysis

**Introduction:**  
The project analyzed manufacturing downtime data for a beverage production line managed by Wolf Cola. The goal was to identify inefficiencies and provide actionable recommendations to improve productivity.  

**Problem:**  
The production line faced frequent downtimes caused by various factors such as machine adjustments, inventory shortages, and operator errors. These inefficiencies reduced overall line efficiency and productivity.  

**Objective:**  
- Calculate and assess overall line efficiency.  
- Identify key downtime factors impacting productivity.  
- Evaluate downtime by operator to pinpoint training and process improvement needs.  

**Conclusion:**  
The analysis, conducted using advanced Excel functions, pivot tables, and charts, revealed that the top five downtime factors accounted for 80% of the total downtime. Recommendations were made for targeted operator training, proactive machine maintenance, and process improvements to enhance production efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.
